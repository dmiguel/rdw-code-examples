<h1 id="responsive-design-workflow">Responsive Design Workflow</h1>
<p>by Stephen Hay</p>
<p>In our industry, everything changes quickly, usually for the better. We have more and better tools for creating websites and applications that work across multiple platforms. Oddly enough, design workflow hasn't changed much, and what has changed is often for worse. Through the years, increasing focus on bloated client deliverables has hurt both content and design, often reducing these disciplines to fill-in-the-blank and color-by-numbers exercises, respectively. Old-school workflow is simply not effective on our multiplatform web.</p>
<p>Responsive Design Workflow explores:</p>
<ul>
<li>A content-based approach to design workflow that's grounded in our multiplatform reality, not fixed-width Photoshop comps and overproduced wireframes.</li>
<li>How to avoid being surprised by the realities of multiplatform websites when practicing responsive web design.</li>
<li>How to better manage client expectations and development requirements.</li>
<li>A practical approach for designing in the browser.</li>
<li>A method of design documentation that will prove more useful than static Photoshop comps.</li>
</ul>
